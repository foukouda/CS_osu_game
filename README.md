# Data Analyser and OSU Python Script

## Overview
This repository contains two main components:

1. **OSU Python Script (`osu.py`)**: A script that appears to interact with or process OSU game-related data.
2. **Data Analyser Notebook (`data_analyser.ipynb`)**: A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing datasets, likely focused on the results stored in the CSV file.
3. **Game Results Data (`game_results.csv`)**: A CSV file containing game-related data for analysis.

## Features
- **Python Script (`osu.py`)**:
  - Handles specific operations related to OSU or gaming data.
  - Customizable and extendable for additional features.
- **Jupyter Notebook (`data_analyser.ipynb`)**:
  - Allows data exploration and visualization.
  - Ideal for understanding trends and patterns in game data.
- **CSV Data (`game_results.csv`)**:
  - Provides structured data for analysis.
  - Can be modified or replaced with other datasets.
